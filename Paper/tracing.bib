  abstract =     "The OpenAD/F tool allows the evaluation of derivatives of functions defined by a Fortran 
                  program. The derivative evaluation is performed by a Fortran code resulting from the 
                  analysis and transformation of the original program that defines the function of interest. 
                  OpenADF has been designed with a particular emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and the 
                  use of open source components. While the code transformation follows the basic principles 
                  of automatic differentiation, the tool implements new algorithmic approaches at various 
                  levels, for example, for basic block preaccumulation and call graph reversal. Unlike most
                  other automatic differentiation tools, OpenAD/F uses components provided by the OpenAD 
                  framework, which supports a comparatively easy extension of the code transformations in a 
                  language-independent fashion. It uses code analysis results implemented in the OpenAnalysis 
                  component. The interface to the language-independent transformation engine is an XML-based 
                  format, specified through an XML schema. The implemented transformation algorithms allow 
                  efficient derivative computations using locally optimized cross-country sequences of vertex, 
                  edge, and face elimination steps. Specifically, for the generation of adjoint codes, OpenAD/F 
                  supports various code reversal schemes with hierarchical checkpointing at the subroutine
                  level. As an example from geophysical fluid dynamics a nonlinear time-dependent scalable, 
                  yet simple, barotropic ocean model is considered. OpenAD/F's reverse mode is applied to compute 
                  sensitivities of some of the model's transport properties with respect to gridded fields 
                  such as bottom topography as independent (control) variables.",
